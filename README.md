# PokerHands

This is an implementation of the Poker Hands Coding Dojo Kata. To specify input for this program, simply change the input file, following the current format of "Black: <black's hand>  White: <white's hand>" for each round you want ranked.

# Compile/Run

Probably the easiest way to run this program is to import it into Eclipse and run it that way. Otherwise, to run in Windows ensure your classpath is configured correctly for both java and JUnit, then navigate to the src directory and type: 

> javac poker/*.java

then, execute the program with:

> java poker.Solution

This will run the program with the file "input" as input.
